To run this python program, one must open command prompt and run the program using the command:

py Cash.py

This program prompts the user for the amount of change they need returned. This program uses a greedy
algorithm to determine the least amount of coins needed to return to satisfy the amount needed. This program 
uses USD, and thus the coins used to determine change are:

Quarters: $0.25
Dimes: $0.10
Nickels: $0.05
Pennies: $0.01

The version of python I used is Python 3.7
